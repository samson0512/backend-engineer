RESTful API for Project Management
This project is a RESTful API for a simple project management system, developed as a solution for the backend engineer take-home challenge. It is built with Python using the FastAPI framework and uses SQLAlchemy for database interactions with a SQLite database.

The entire application is containerized using Docker for easy setup and deployment.
